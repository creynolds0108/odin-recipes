      <h1>Grandma's Ginger Snap Cookies</h1>

      <p>These gingersnap cookies will melt in your mouth. I received this ginger cookie recipe from my grandmother; it's been enjoyed in my family since 1899.</p>
      <p>I will be the first to admit, I have never been a huge gingersnap cookie girl. Spiced cookies have never been a first-choice cookie. BUT last year during my 12 Days of Christmas Cookies I shared my recipe for Soft Molasses Cookies and…well…I loved them. They are an entirely different texture than the Gingersnaps I am sharing today, but the taste is similar. So I had a feeling if I could develop a chewy version of that molasses cookie, it would be a winner. And I will tell you…they are DEFINITELY a winner!</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons baking soda </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
          <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
          <li>¾ cup shortening </li>
          <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
          <li>1 egg</li>
          <li>¼ cup dark molasses </li>
          <li>⅓ cup cinnamon sugar </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Sift flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir the mixture until blended, then sift a second time into another bowl.</li>
          <li>Place shortening in a mixing bowl and beat until creamy. Gradually mix in white sugar. Beat in egg and dark molasses until light and fluffy. Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture into the shortening mixture; stir to thoroughly blend. Sift in the remaining flour mixture and mix together until a soft dough forms.</li>
          <li>Pinch off small amounts of dough and roll them into 1-inch-diameter balls between your hands. Roll each ball in cinnamon sugar, then place 2-inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are rounded and slightly cracked, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container.</li>
